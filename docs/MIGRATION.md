# Migrating an Existing Site to Loomwork

This guide is for migrating an existing website (Astro-based or otherwise) onto
the Loomwork framework. Unlike UPGRADE.md (which covers pulling new framework
versions into an already-forked site), this covers the one-time process of
adopting Loomwork from scratch.

The target use case: you have a live site with content you want to keep, and you
want Loomwork's theme system (10 built-in themes with dark mode), reader controls
(floating preferences panel), content collections, multiple page templates
(including longform), and zero-config Cloudflare deployment.

---

## Overview

The migration has four phases:

1. **Scaffold** — Clone loomwork, set up your repo
2. **Configure** — Set site identity, pick a theme, enable reader controls
3. **Migrate content** — Convert existing pages to MDX in content collections
4. **Verify and deploy** — Build, test 2.0 features, push

---

## Phase 1: Scaffold

### 1.1 Clone loomwork into a new directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danrichardson/loomwork.git my-site
cd my-site
```

### 1.2 Set up remotes

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USER/YOUR-SITE.git
git remote add loomwork https://github.com/danrichardson/loomwork.git
```

### 1.3 Clean up loomwork placeholder files

Delete loomwork's demo content and repo-specific docs:

```bash
# Loomwork repo docs (not part of the framework)
rm -f MOBILE_README.md MOBILE_PROJECT.md Notes.md PROJECT.md
rm -f UPGRADE-PROMPT.md VERIFICATION_AGENT_PROMPT.md
rm -rf docs/

# Placeholder content pages
rm -f src/content/pages/about_Loomwork.mdx
rm -f src/content/pages/guide.mdx
rm -f src/content/pages/mobile-app.mdx
rm -f src/content/pages/building.mdx
rm -f src/content/pages/page-types.mdx
rm -f src/content/pages/reader-controls.mdx
rm -f src/content/pages/theming.mdx
rm -rf src/content/pages/deep-dives/

# Placeholder images
rm -f public/images/1771364152056-image.jpg
```

Keep `UPGRADE.md` — you'll need it for future framework updates.

**Do NOT delete these framework files:**
- `src/themes/_index.ts` (theme registry)
- `public/themes/*.css` (10 built-in theme stylesheets)
- `public/mobile/` (PWA manifest and service worker)
- `public/_headers`, `public/_redirects`, `public/.assetsignore`

### 1.4 Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 1.5 What NOT to bring from your old site

If you're migrating from an existing Astro (or other) site, do **not** copy
these into the Loomwork clone:

- **Old layouts** — Loomwork provides `Base.astro`, `Content.astro`, and
  `Longform.astro`. Your old layouts won't work with Loomwork's theme system,
  reader controls, or content collections.
- **Old global CSS** — Loomwork's `global.css` + theme CSS replaces your old
  stylesheet. Copying it over will break themes and dark mode.
- **Old package.json** — Loomwork has its own dependencies. Only bring over
  site-specific dependencies by running `npm install <package>` after setup.
- **Old Astro config** — Only copy the `site` URL field into Loomwork's
  `astro.config.mjs`. Don't replace the whole file.

What you SHOULD bring:
- **Content** (text, images) → Phase 3
- **Custom components** (React islands, site-specific Astro components) →
  put in `src/components/` with unique names that don't collide with
  framework components (see 2.8 below)
- **Homepage design** → rebuild in `src/pages/index.astro` using CSS variables

---

## Phase 2: Configure

### 2.1 Site identity (`src/site.config.ts`)

This is the most important file. Update every field:

```typescript
export const SITE = {
  name: "Your Site Name",
  tagline: "Your tagline",
  description: "SEO description for the site (max 160 chars).",
  url: "https://www.yoursite.com",
  author: "Your Name",
  email: "you@yoursite.com",

  nav_home: true,
  nav: [
    { label: "About", href: "/about" },
    { label: "Services", href: "/services" },
    // ... your pages
  ],

  // Leave empty — the theme loads its own fonts automatically.
  // Only set this if you want to override the theme's font choices.
  fonts_url: "",

  social: {
    github: "https://github.com/you",
  },

  footer: {
    company: "Your Company, LLC",
    license: "MIT License",  // or remove
  },

  // Pick a built-in theme — provides full color palette, fonts, dark mode:
  // "manuscript", "brutalist", "atelier", "terminal", "gazette",
  // "alpine", "campfire", "moonrise", "fieldnotes", "neon"
  theme: "manuscript",

  // Floating reader preferences panel (dark mode, font size, TOC, width, focus)
  reader_controls: true,
};
```

### 2.2 Site styles (`src/styles/site.css`)

Since you picked a theme above, the theme already provides a complete color
palette, font stack, and dark mode. You do **not** need to redefine all the
CSS variables.

Keep `site.css` minimal — only override what's specific to your brand:

```css
/* src/styles/site.css */
:root {
  /* Optional: tweak the theme's accent color to match your brand */
  --color-accent:       #2d6a4f;
  --color-accent-hover: #1b4332;
}

/* Any site-specific styles go here too */
```

**Do NOT** redefine the full color palette (`--color-bg`, `--color-text`,
`--color-surface`, etc.) or font families — that's the theme's job. If you
need to override fonts, set `fonts_url` in site.config.ts and override
`--font-body` / `--font-heading` here.

Goal: The `:root` variable override block should be under ~30 lines. But
`site.css` can be as long as it needs to be — site-specific component styles
(homepage hero, feature cards, custom section layouts, etc.) all belong here
too. Just make sure those styles use `var(--color-*)` references instead of
hardcoded hex values so they work with themes and dark mode.

### 2.3 Astro config (`astro.config.mjs`)

Update the `site` field:

```javascript
site: "https://www.yoursite.com",
```

### 2.4 Cloudflare config (`wrangler.toml`)

Update the project name:

```toml
name = "your-site"
```

If you have custom domain routes, add them here.

### 2.5 Package metadata (`package.json`)

Update `name` and `description`:

```json
{
  "name": "your-site",
  "description": "Your site description"
}
```

### 2.6 Homepage (`src/pages/index.astro`)

Replace the loomwork placeholder homepage entirely. This is a site file — you
have full control. Import `Base` layout and build your page:

```astro
---
import Base from "../layouts/Base.astro";
import { SITE } from "../site.config";
---
<Base title={SITE.name} description={SITE.description}>
  <main>
    <!-- Your homepage content -->
  </main>
</Base>
```

**Important:** Use CSS variables for all colors on the homepage — do not
hardcode hex values. This ensures the page respects themes and dark mode:
- Backgrounds: `var(--color-bg)`, `var(--color-bg-alt)`, `var(--color-surface)`
- Text: `var(--color-text)`, `var(--color-text-muted)`
- Accent: `var(--color-accent)`, `var(--color-accent-hover)`, `var(--color-accent-light)`
- Borders: `var(--color-border)`

If you're converting a complex homepage from your old site, here's the process:
1. Copy the HTML structure into `index.astro` inside the `<Base>` wrapper
2. Move all `<style>` blocks into `src/styles/site.css`
3. Find-and-replace every hardcoded color with the nearest CSS variable:
   - Light backgrounds (`#f5f5f0`, `#fff`, `#fafafa`) → `var(--color-bg)` or `var(--color-bg-alt)`
   - Dark text (`#111`, `#333`, `#1a1a1a`) → `var(--color-text)`
   - Muted text (`#666`, `#888`, `#999`) → `var(--color-text-muted)`
   - Brand/accent colors → `var(--color-accent)`
   - Borders (`#ddd`, `#e0e0e0`) → `var(--color-border)`
4. Test dark mode — toggle it in reader controls and verify nothing is invisible

### 2.7 README

```bash
echo "# Your Site Name" > README.md
```

### 2.8 Custom components

If your old site has custom components (React islands, Astro components for
case studies, etc.), put them in `src/components/` alongside the framework
components. This is safe because:

- Your custom files have different names than the framework components
- `git merge loomwork/main` only conflicts on files **both sides changed**
- A file that only exists in your repo will never conflict

Framework component names to avoid (these are taken):
`Callout.astro`, `DemoControl.astro`, `Footer.astro`, `Header.astro`,
`ReaderControls.astro`, `ReadingEnhancements.astro`, `TableOfContents.astro`,
`ThemePicker.astro`, `YouTube.astro`

Anything else (e.g., `CaseStudy.astro`, `HeroStats.astro`, `PricingTable.tsx`)
is yours and will merge cleanly forever.

## Phase 3: Migrate Content

### 3.1 Content structure

All content pages go in `src/content/pages/` as `.mdx` files. The file path
becomes the URL:

| File | URL |
|------|-----|
| `src/content/pages/about.mdx` | `/about` |
| `src/content/pages/work.mdx` | `/work` |
| `src/content/pages/services/consulting.mdx` | `/services/consulting` |

### 3.2 Frontmatter schema

Every content page needs frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "SEO description, max 160 characters."
section: "optional-group"     # groups pages for longform sidebar
nav_title: "Short Nav Label"  # optional, used in nav if different from title
nav_order: 10                 # lower = earlier in nav order
template: "default"           # default | landing | guide | tool | longform
draft: false
date_created: 2026-01-15
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

### 3.3 Template selection guide

Choose templates based on page purpose:

| Template | Best for |
|----------|----------|
| `default` | Standard articles, about pages, policies |
| `landing` | Wide hero sections, feature grids, marketing pages |
| `guide` | Documentation, tutorials — sticky TOC sidebar on desktop |
| `tool` | Utility pages with React components |
| `longform` | Deep dives, case studies — split-panel with fixed sidebar |

**Use at least one `longform` page.** This is a key 2.0 feature — the
split-panel layout with a fixed sidebar is ideal for deep dives, case studies,
or any long-form content. It verifies the Longform.astro layout works in your
site.

The `section` field in frontmatter matters for longform pages — it controls
which pages appear together in the longform sidebar. All pages with the same
`section` value are grouped. Example: if you have three case studies, give
them all `section: "case-studies"` and they'll share a sidebar index.

For a single standalone longform page, set `section` to any value (e.g.
`section: "deep-dives"`) — it will just show that one page in the sidebar.

### 3.4 Using components in MDX

```mdx
import Callout from '../../components/Callout.astro';

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro tip">
  Callout components render inline in your markdown.
</Callout>
```

Available types: `info`, `warning`, `tip`, `danger`.

YouTube embeds:

```mdx
import YouTube from '../../components/YouTube.astro';

<YouTube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />
```

### 3.5 Content migration checklist

For each page on your existing site:

- [ ] Create the `.mdx` file with correct frontmatter
- [ ] Copy/convert the content body (HTML to Markdown if needed)
- [ ] Update internal links to use new URL paths
- [ ] Move images to `public/images/` and update references
- [ ] Add Callout components where appropriate
- [ ] Verify the page renders in dev server

### 3.6 Blog posts (optional)

If your site has blog posts, create them in `src/content/posts/`:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Post description, max 160 chars."
date: 2026-01-15
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["tag1"]
draft: false
---
```

---

## Phase 4: Verify and Deploy

### 4.1 Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Confirm:
- Zero errors (warnings about sharp/KV are expected)
- All your content pages appear in the output
- Homepage renders (`dist/index.html`)
- Mobile editor renders (`dist/mobile/index.html`)
- All 10 theme CSS files are in `dist/themes/` (alpine.css, atelier.css, brutalist.css, campfire.css, fieldnotes.css, gazette.css, manuscript.css, moonrise.css, neon.css, terminal.css)
- No loomwork placeholder page slugs in the output (about_Loomwork, guide, mobile-app, building, theming, page-types, reader-controls)

### 4.2 Dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Walk through every page at http://localhost:4321. Check:
- All nav links resolve to real pages
- No dead links in content
- Images load correctly
- The theme is visibly active (styled fonts, colors, not raw system defaults)
- The reader controls gear icon (⚙) appears in the bottom-right corner
- Dark mode toggle works in the reader controls panel
- The longform template page renders with the split-panel layout
- Mobile responsive layout works

### 4.3 Scrub for leftover references

Search for any references to the old site or loomwork placeholders:

```bash
grep -r "loomwork" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.css" --include="*.astro" --include="*.mdx" -l
```

Framework files will legitimately contain "loomwork" in comments — that's fine.
Site files should have zero loomwork references.

### 4.4 Initial commit and push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Migrate to Loomwork framework"
git push origin main
```

### 4.5 Cloudflare Pages setup

1. Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → Create → Connect to Git
2. Select your repo and branch (`main`)
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Output directory: `dist`
5. Add custom domains in Settings → Domains & Routes

First deploy takes 1-2 minutes. Subsequent pushes auto-deploy in ~30 seconds.

---

## Post-Migration: Pulling Future Updates

You're now a standard Loomwork site. Future framework updates use the normal
upgrade path:

```bash
git fetch loomwork
git merge loomwork/main
npm install
npm run build
git push origin main
```

See `UPGRADE.md` for the full upgrade guide with conflict resolution details.

## Migration Notes for Specific Site Types

### Portfolio / consulting sites (e.g. throughlinetech.net)

These sites typically have:
- Custom homepage with hero, stats, and feature cards
- Case studies or work examples with structured layouts
- About page with timeline
- Contact / "let's talk" page

Mapping to Loomwork:

| Existing page | Loomwork approach |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Homepage | Custom `src/pages/index.astro` — full control |
| Case Studies | `longform` template — split-panel layout is ideal for structured narratives |
| About | `default` template |
| Projects | `guide` template with cards in MDX |
| Contact | Custom `src/pages/start.astro` or `default` template with mailto links |

Theme recommendation for consulting/professional sites: `manuscript` (warm,
editorial) or `alpine` (clean, modern). Enable `reader_controls: true` —
clients appreciate dark mode and font size control.

For case study pages with repeated structure (NOTICED / BUILT / RESULT), create
a custom Astro component and import it in MDX:

```astro
---
// src/components/CaseStudy.astro
const { noticed, built, result } = Astro.props;
---
<div class="case-study">
  <div class="phase"><h4>Noticed</h4><p>{noticed}</p></div>
  <div class="phase"><h4>Built</h4><p>{built}</p></div>
  <div class="phase"><h4>Result</h4><p>{result}</p></div>
</div>
```

For contact forms, Loomwork doesn't include server-side form handling. Options:
- Simple mailto link (no form needed)
- Cloudflare Workers function (add to `functions/` directory)
- Third-party form service (Formspree, Tally, etc.)
- Custom React island with `client:load`

### Content-heavy sites

Sites with many pages benefit from Loomwork's content collections and template
system. Use `guide` template for anything that benefits from a persistent TOC
sidebar, and `longform` for deep dives with a sidebar index.

### Blog-focused sites

Use `src/content/posts/` for date-ordered blog content. You'll need to create
a blog index page at `src/pages/blog.astro` (this is a site file, not provided
by the framework).
